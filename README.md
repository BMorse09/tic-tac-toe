 WEB DEVELOPMENT IMMERSIVE PROJECT 1: TIC TAC TOE

For our first project I used multiple technologies to build an
SPA Tic-Tac-Toe game. These technologies include:

-   JavaScript
-   JQuery
-   AJAX
-   HTML
-   SCSS / SASS
-   Bootstrap

I began planning with a wireframe aimed towards meeting all the basic
requirements of the project; my planning included a simple page
layout with user authentication functionality, along with game
logic and basic game/server interaction. I also developed user
stories to help guide my planning process:

-   As a user, I want to play tic-tac-toe against a friend
-   As a user, I want to register log-in so that I can save and track my games
-   As a user, I want to track my past game data
-   As a user, I want to open previous games that are saved
-   As a user, I want a notification that clearly shows the outcome of a game

Here's a link to my initial wireframe: http://imgur.com/a/8XzB5

Once wireframing and basic planning were complete, I began
building my project with HTML and minimal CSS, then moved on to
designing and creating my gameboard along with game
logic - i.e. win and tie conditions. Once my gameboard and
logic were complete, I began building my user authentication
requirements and implementing ajax requests for POST, PATCH and DELETE.

My game meets basic project requirements, but there are a number of
aspects across the board that I would like to improve moving forward.
Foremost, I want to create a more advanced page layout - specifically
the game board - and include an animation upon a player victory. I would
also love to make the game multiplayer, allowing for two authenticated
players on different computers to play each other.
